# FindMy

Query Apple's Find My network, allowing none Apple devices to retrieve the location reports.

This project based on all the hard work of, and is a combination of the following projects:

1. https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/
2. https://github.com/biemster/FindMy
3. https://github.com/Dadoum/anisette-v3-server
4. https://github.com/mrmay-dev/owntags



## Installation and Setup for Web Service

ðŸ“º Installation and Walkthrough Video: https://youtu.be/yC2HIPDSxlM

This project only need a free Apple ID with SMS 2FA properly setup. If you don't have any, follow one of the many 
guides found on the internet. 

**Using your personal Apple ID is strongly discouraged. You are recommended to create a blank Apple ID for experimental purpose.**  If you ran into issue of "KeyError service-data", especially you are using an existing account rather than a new account, you may want to refer to https://github.com/Chapoly1305/FindMy/issues/9 .


### Steps

1. Install [docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/ubuntu/) and Python3-pip. Python3-venv is also strongly recommended.

2. The anisetter service shall run on the same device of this project. We use docker [image](https://hub.docker.com/r/dadoum/anisette-v3-server/tags) deployment.
   Here is the example command for Linux. If the system rebooted, this docker service will automatically start after reboot.

```bash
docker run -d --restart always --name anisette-v3 -p 6969:6969 dadoum/anisette-v3-server:latest
```

If docker is not applicable, you may setup [manually](https://github.com/Dadoum/anisette-v3-server). 

3. After deployed `anisette-v3-server`, you may validate the service is running by sending a `curl` request:

```bash
curl -I http://localhost:6969
```

You will receive a response like below. 

```json
{
  "X-Apple-I-Client-Time": "...",
  "X-Apple-I-MD": "...",
  "X-Apple-I-MD-LU": "...",
  "X-Apple-I-MD-M": "...",
  "X-Apple-I-MD-RINFO": "...",
  "X-Apple-I-SRL-NO": "0",
  "X-Apple-I-TimeZone": "UTC",
  "X-Apple-Locale": "en_US",
  "X-MMe-Client-Info": "<MacBookPro13,2> <macOS;13.1;22C65> <com.apple.AuthKit/1 (com.apple.dt.Xcode/3594.4.19)>",
  "X-Mme-Device-Id": "..."
}
```

4. Then, clone this repository, Navigate to `FindMy` directory, and install the required python packages:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Chapoly1305/FindMy.git
cd FindMy

# Optionally create and use the virtual environment
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Start the Web Service.
python3 web_service.py
```

**Hint:** This web service will die if the shell exited or system reboot. You could use `nohup`, `screen`, or set up a systemd service to keep it alive.

## API Usage

The APIs are created with FastAPI, the documentations are written inline and can be accessed on website path http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs or http://127.0.0.1:8000/redoc. 




## Traditional Key File Method

### Using the Key Generation Tool

The `generate_keys.py` script creates the cryptographic keys needed for device tracking. Here's how to use it:

**Basic Key Generation**
```bash
# Generate a single key pair
python3 generate_keys.py

# Generate multiple key pairs
python3 generate_keys.py -n 5

# Add a prefix to key files
python3 generate_keys.py -p mydevice

# Command Line Options
# -n, --nkeys: Number of key pairs to generate (default: 1)
# -p, --prefix: Prefix for the generated key files
# -y, --yaml: Generate a YAML file containing the list of keys
# -v, --verbose: Print keys as they are generated
```


**Understanding the Generated Keys**
Each `.keys` file contains three components:
1. Private Key: Keep this secret! Used for decrypting location reports
2. Advertisement Key: Used for broadcasting BLE messages
3. Hashed Advertisement Key: Used for requesting location reports from Apple

The keys are stored in the `keys/` directory with filenames based on their hashed values.



### Advertise with Improved HCI.py on Linux

The OpenHayStack HCI.py has a problem that it needs to modify the public address of an adapter. However, not all the adapter support address modification. The HCI.py provided in OpenHayStack works only on specific chip (Broadcom for Raspberry Pi). To advertise on other Linux, we offer an improved version. With this version, you will able to advertise with basically any adapter supporting BLE. 

**Root Privilege Required.** 

```bash
# Basic Usage
sudo python3 hci.py --hex <56_CHAR_HEX>

# Using a specific adapter with given adapter and instance id:
sudo python3 hci.py --hex 112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF --adapter hci0 --instance 05

# Required Argument
# --hex: Paste your public key here. We expect a 56-character hexadecimal string.
#        Example: `--hex 112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF00112233445566778899AABBCCDDEEFF`

# Optional Arguments
# --adv_method`: Choose the advertising method (default: "extended"). extended: Use BLE 5.0 extended advertising. traditional: Use traditional advertising (not yet implemented)
# --instance: Advertisement instance index (default: "05"). Usually, the adapter can advertise with multiple instances. Different adapter supports different quantity.
# --adapter: Bluetooth adapter name (default: "hci0")
```

**Here is the explanation how it works.**

The adapter on Linux generally supports HCI command, defined in Bluetooth specification. The script use the `hcitool` to directly configure the address and send BLE advertisement. The advertisement is sent using random static address, instead of public address. This is critically important because the OpenHayStack method of using public address will slowly lossing coverage when Apple deploying mitigation on iOS 18.2. 



### Advertise and Track without Root Privileges

Our recent research shows the device maybe tracked without using root privileges. Our discovery will be published on **USENIX 2025**! Please stay tuned, we will provided more information and software once the paper is released to public. 



### Requesting Location Reports

The `request_reports.py` script fetches location data for your tracked devices from Apple's servers.

**Basic Usage**
```bash
# Request reports for all keys in the keys directory
python3 request_reports.py

# Request reports for specific time period
python3 request_reports.py -H 48  # Last 48 hours

# Request reports for keys with specific prefix
python3 request_reports.py -p mydevice

#Command Line Options
# -H, --hours: Only show reports newer than specified hours (default: 24)
# -p, --prefix: Only use keyfiles starting with this prefix
# -r, --regen: Regenerate search-party-token
# -t, --trusteddevice: Use trusted device for 2FA instead of SMS
```



## Additional Information

### anisette-v3-server

Q: What does this external project do? The SMS code is only asked once, in where and how is the information stored?

A: Anisette is similar to a device fingerprint. It is intended to be stored on an Apple device once it becomes trusted. 
Subsequent requests made by this "device" using this fingerprint and same Apple account will not trigger the 2FA again. 
The first call (icloud_login_mobileme) is used to obtain the search party token. The subsequent calls 
(generate_anisette_headers) use the cached search party token from the first call as the password and the dsid as the 
username. I (@biemster) have observed that the search party tokens change when using different sources for anisette data,
possibly due to various reasons. If it's deployed as a docker container, the storage location is $HOME/.config/anisette-v3/
adi.pb and device.json. These numbers together generate a validation code like OTP, which then undergoes a process of 
Mixed Boolean Arithmetic to produce two anisette headers for the request. One header represents a relatively static 
machine serial, while the other header contains a frequently changing OTP. 
If you switch to https://github.com/Dadoum/pyprovision, you will obtain the ADI data in the anisette folder.
